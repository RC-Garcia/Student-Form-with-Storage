In this code, I've added a '.logo-container' class to create a centered container for the logo. The background color, text color, and form styling have also been adjusted to incorporate green and yellow colors. Replace the placeholder image tag with the actual image tag for the NEHS-Senior High School logo. Remember to replace "path/to/your/logo.png" with the actual path to the logo image file. Adjust the styling and layout further as needed.
